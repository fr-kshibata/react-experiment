React Experiment Using Org-API
=====================

This will use material UI. Will be very basic.

### TODO
[ ] Add material UI
[ ] ~~add db~~
[ ] integrate to api to consume
[ ] create custom components
[ ] use redux
[ ] add routing
[ ] add inline styles
[ ] add production server (currently using dev webpack server)
[ ] add theme
[ ] understand Webpack
[ ] understand hot reload
[ ] make it work for react native

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Linting

This  project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.

### Missing Features

This is purposefully simple to show the minimal configuration for React Hot Loader. For a real project, you'll want to add a separate config for production with hot reloading disabled and minification enabled. You'll also want to add a router, styles and maybe combine dev server with an existing server. This is out of scope of this boilerplate, but you may want to look into [other starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#starter-kits).
